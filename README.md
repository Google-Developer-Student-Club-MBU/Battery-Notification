# Battery-Notification

Battery notification is a feature that allows users to be notified when their battery level is low. This can be useful for preventing users from running out of battery and being unable to use their devices.

Battery notification can be implemented in a variety of ways, but one common approach is to use a system tray icon. The system tray is a small area in the taskbar where users can see icons for frequently used applications and system tools.

When the battery level is low, the system tray icon can change color or display a message to notify the user. The user can then click on the icon to open a dialog box that provides more information about the battery level and options for charging the device.
